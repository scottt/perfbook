This is a minor fork of Paul McKenney's "Is Parallel Programming Hard?" [book repository](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulmck/perfbook.git):
* The content is just before the ["cut.2014.06.06a"](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulmck/perfbook.git/commit/?h=cut.2014.06.06a&id=fef5a70e8660a45f0f9009e7cd37356540dacb6e) tag (circa. Jun 6, 2014) where he removed the appendix with detailed RCU implementation discussions
* PDF formatting improvements, most importantly hyperflinks between Quick Quiz questions and answers, were backported from the master branch circa. Jul 2017
